- Note that negative z-axis points into the viewport.
- Change Vec3 to an array; it's natural to associate 0 with x, 1 with y, and 2 with z. This will be more performant and simpler to iterate.
- Note that `Rc<dyn Hittable>` give us the option of sharing objects between worlds.
- Decide if it's worth giving the functions that return random items access to a common rng, created in advance, as I originally did by making them methods `camera`.
- Keep track of the previous hit record material so that the next refraction index can be calculated rather than leaving it to the user of the library to get it right in advance.
- Handle 0. radius being passed to `Sphere` constructor.
- Note reversal of definition of `refraction_index` in `scatter` in `Material` for `Dielectric` from the book.
