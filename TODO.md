- SmallRng -> Rng trait in vec3 to be more flexible?
- Make a Vec3 -> ProjectionOperator function in vec3.
- Allow Disk to be made either from normal or spanning vectors of plane.
- Tidy names of items in world in `various.rs`.
- Implement indexing and iteration for `Color`.
- When texture is implemented, look again at `Isotropic` and add attentuation.
- Distinguish phase functions as a special sort of `Material`, by analogy with how `ConstantMedium` belongs to the submodule `volumes` of `hittables`?
- Make submodules for each `Material`?
- Dry out code for planar primitives such as `Disk` and `Quad`?
- Make `Cube` out of `Quad`s?
