- SmallRng -> Rng trait in vec3 to be more flexible?
- Add more tests.
- Make a Vec3 -> ProjectionOperator function in vec3.
- Dry out code for Plan, Quad, and Disk. Use quads to make the cube? Make a general planar primitive struct or trait?
- Allow Disk to be made either from normal or spanning vectors of plane.
- Tidy names of items in world in `various.rs`.
- Implement indexing and iteration for `Color`.
- When texture is implemented, look again at `isotropic` and add attentuation.
- Distinguish phase functions as a special sort of `Material`?
